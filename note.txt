The following is a doctor visit note:

```
**Patient:** John Doe  
**DOB:** 01/01/1968  
**Date:** 03/18/2025

**Chief Complaint:**  
Chest pain

**Subjective:**  
Mr. Doe is a 55-year-old male who presents with a complaint of central chest pain that started approximately 2 hours ago while at rest. He describes the pain as a pressure-like sensation, sometimes radiating to his left arm, and accompanied by mild shortness of breath and lightheadedness. He denies nausea, diaphoresis, or palpitations. The patient reports that his father suffered a stroke at age 65 and his mother has a history of type 2 diabetes, which he recognizes as potential risk factors for cardiovascular disease. No previous similar episodes are noted.

**Objective:**  
- **Vital Signs:** Temperature 98.6°F; Heart Rate 92 bpm; Blood Pressure 140/88 mmHg; Respiratory Rate 18/min; SpO2 97% on room air.  
- **General:** Patient appears mildly distressed due to discomfort but is alert and oriented.  
- **Cardiovascular:** Regular rate and rhythm; no murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted on auscultation.  
- **Respiratory:** Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes or crackles.  
- **Abdominal/Extremities:** Abdomen soft and non-tender; no peripheral edema observed.

**Assessment:**  
1. **Chest Pain** – Differential includes angina or early acute coronary syndrome, especially given the family history and symptom profile.  
2. **Cardiovascular Risk Factors** – Family history of stroke and diabetes increases the patient’s risk for coronary artery disease.

**Plan:**  
- **Diagnostics:**  
  - Order stat EKG to assess for ischemic changes.  
  - Obtain cardiac enzymes (troponin, CK-MB) to evaluate for myocardial injury.  
  - Consider a chest X-ray to rule out alternative causes of chest pain (e.g., pulmonary pathology).  
- **Management:**  
  - Initiate oxygen if needed and monitor vital signs closely.  
  - If EKG or enzyme levels suggest myocardial ischemia, prepare for further management per ACS protocol.  
- **Risk Factor Counseling:**  
  - Educate the patient on the importance of lifestyle modifications including diet and exercise.  
  - Discuss potential referral to cardiology for further evaluation and risk stratification.  
- **Follow-Up:**  
  - Reassess the patient’s symptoms and vital signs continuously.  
  - Instruct the patient to seek immediate medical attention if pain worsens or new symptoms (e.g., shortness of breath, diaphoresis) develop.
